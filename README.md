#DSA Practice

This repository has my implememntations of core data structures and algorithms in java. 

I am learning from FreeCodeCamp and Destination FAANG's [Data Structures and Algorithms Mega Course – Master Technical Interviews in 49 Hours.](https://youtu.be/xwI5OBEnsZU?si=ICBPhaGB8vnB5CGy)

Goal: Learn fundamentals and eventually master DSA for internships and backend engineering.
